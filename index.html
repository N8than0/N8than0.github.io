        <h2>Hi.</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Third-Year Computer Science student at the University of Washington - Seattle.
          I enjoy coding and weightlifting on my spare time!

          <span>The first language that I learned was Java. I have 2+ years of experience and have
        built numerous projects with this language. I really enjoy object oriented programming as a whole,
        and I hope to continue to grow my knowledge in OOP.

        <h2>About Me:</h2>
          <p> I am a First-Generation Latino student who grew up in a small town
            in Washington. My favorite part of being in school so far has been experiencing things
            that I can share with my family. Growing up in a lower-income household, my parents had to
            work a lot of hours, and that meant that they had to give up some of their youth in order to
            make sure that we were okay, so I hope to one day repay them and travel with them throughout the
            world!
