      <h2>Hi.</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Third-Year Computer Science student at the University of Washington - Seattle.
        I enjoy coding and weightlifting on my spare time!

    <h2>Skills/Languages</h2>
    <div class="skills">
      <h3>Java</h3>
      <img class="icon" src="images/java.png" alt="java">
      <p class="inline">
        The first language that I learned was Java. I have 2+ years of experience and have
        built numerous projects with this language. I really enjoy object oriented programming as a whole,
        and I hope to continue to grow my knowledge in OOP.
      </p>

      <h3>Javasript/Typescript</h3>

      <img class="icon" src="images/typescript.png" alt="JSTS">
      <p>
        I am currently learning scripting languages like Javascript and Typescript,
        with my knowledge mostly coming from a project that was done using React in a recently taken
        Software Design class at the University of Washington.

      <img class="icon" src="images/html.png" alt="HTCS">
      <p>
        I am currently learning web development languages like HTML and CSS
        with most of my knowledge coming from a current summer course that I am taking.
        This website is a way to show off what I have learned.

      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p> I am a First-Generation Latino student who grew up in a small town
        in Washington. My favorite part of being in school so far has been experiencing things
        that I can share with my family. Growing up in a lower-income household, my parents had to
        work a lot of hours, and that meant that they had to give up some of their youth in order to
        make sure that we were okay, so I hope to one day repay them and travel with them throughout the
        world!
